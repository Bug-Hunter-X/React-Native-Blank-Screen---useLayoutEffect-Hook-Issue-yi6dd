This error occurs when using the `useLayoutEffect` hook in React Native. It typically manifests as a blank screen or unexpected rendering behavior. The root cause is often related to how `useLayoutEffect` interacts with native components and asynchronous operations.  Sometimes, the effect attempts to access or modify a component's layout before it's fully rendered, leading to inconsistencies.
